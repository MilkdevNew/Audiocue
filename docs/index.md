# Intro

Welcome to the documentation of [Audiocue](https://github.com/milk-studio/Audiocue).

[Audiocue](https://github.com/milk-studio/Audiocue) is an app for making dialogs and captions both in the same app.

This app has been made for the making of [Milk's Studio](https://www.roblox.com/groups/15945874/Milk-s-Studio#!/about) games but the plugin is now open-source.

The documentation will show you how to add subtitles and dialog from this plugin into your game.
